        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p>A warrior of the Great Plains Battle Clan where they learned to fight with sword, bow, and axe from a young age and is now the most skilled warrior in the lower western isle, or so they tell people. Actually, they come from a fairly average village in the midwest with a loving family that supports their dreams of being a skilled adventurer one day. From time to time they write letters back home, making sure to include a small trinket from their many adventures. Our warrior friend is also quite skilled at all manner of tavern activities including darts, drinking contests, karaoke, and convincing the barkeep to not throw them out for breaking yet another table by jumping up on it to finish the final verse of their favorite drinking song. They travel the land looking for new adventures, butts to kick, and brews to sample. They are particularly fond of cats, especially big cats, and dream of the day they can ride one into battle.
